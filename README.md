##Platform Maze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannyflax/platform_maze.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dannyflax/platform_maze)
This project uses [JOGL](https://www.jogamp.org) and [JOGL Utils](https://github.com/dannyflax/JOGL-Utilities). It was designed as a basis for 3D games in the future. 

The user may walk around the environment using WASD and rotate the camera using the mouse.
